Welcome to Agro Cycle Gan documentation!
==========================================

Agro Cycle Gan is a platform to create syntetic image datasets using CycleGAN. It transforms images from a domain A with some features to a domain B with different features (for example horses to horses, day to night, etc). It uses CycleGAN, which allows to use unsupervised learning to transform images between two domains.
